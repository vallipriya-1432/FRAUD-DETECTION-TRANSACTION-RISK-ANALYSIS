# 🛡️ Fraud Detection & Transaction Risk Analysis

Fraudulent transactions pose a serious threat to financial institutions and customers alike.  
This project demonstrates how machine learning and analytics can strengthen compliance operations by detecting high-risk transactions in real time.  

By identifying patterns in transaction data, we can help risk and audit teams reduce fraud losses** and improve early-warning systems.

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project replicates a real-world Risk & Compliance Analyst workflow —  
using historical credit card data to detect potential fraud and improve monitoring processes.  
The model uses transaction features to predict the likelihood of a transaction being fraudulent.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze credit card transaction data to identify fraudulent behavior  
- Build a classification model to detect high-risk transactions  
- Evaluate model performance using precision, recall, and ROC-AUC  
- Provide actionable insights for compliance and audit teams  

---

## ⚙️ Project Workflow

1. **Data Preparation:** Load and preprocess the credit card dataset  
2. **Exploratory Analysis:** Identify fraud vs non-fraud transaction patterns  
3. **Model Development:** Train a logistic regression model for prediction  
4. **Model Evaluation:** Analyze confusion matrix and ROC-AUC score  
5. **Insights:** Translate technical results into business actions

## 📊 Key Insights

- Fraud accounts for less than 0.2% of total transactions, creating a class imbalance challenge.  
- The Logistic Regression model performed well with strong recall and AUC scores.  
- A high Recall ensures that most fraud cases are detected, minimizing potential financial losses.  
- The model can serve as a real-time fraud alert system, flagging suspicious activity for review.
